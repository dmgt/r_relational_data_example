# Unit 3: Fisheries Collapse Module

This module will focus on understanding and replicating
fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse. 

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database)

First, load in the necessary librarys. Note that this time we need a package we 
haven't used before `readxl`. This package is useful for reading in .xls or 
.xlsx files. As always if you want more info on a package run `?readxl` after 
loading it.

```{r message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
```

## Reading in the tables

```{r}
# download.file("https://depts.washington.edu/ramlegac/wordpress/databaseVersions/RLSADB_v3.0_(assessment_data_only)_excel.zip", 
        #      "ramlegacy.zip")
path <- unzip("ramlegacy.zip")  #unzip the .xls files
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(path) #use the readxl package to identify sheet names 
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = path)  #read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
names(ram) <- sheets # give the list of datatables their assigned sheet names

## check your names
names(ram)

## check your data
head(ram$area)

```



# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

First, We seek to replicate the following figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data. 

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/fish/img/codcollapse.jpg)


## Task 1: Joining the necessary data

To replicate this plot, we need a table with the following columns: `"country"`, `"ssb_unit"`, `"catch_landings_unit"`, `"scientificname"`, `"commonname"`, `"year"`, `"ssb"`, and `"TC"`. 

Using the `select()` and `join()` functions you were introduced to in in Module 1,
build a tidy table with the desired columns. 

```{r}
 
```

## Task 2: Mapping the Area table to marine regions

In order to replicate the collapse of Atlantic Cod, 
we need to be able to map area table from the Ram database to the marine regions. 

*As an aside, this database is unclear what kind of areas the `area` table is using, they do not appear to be LMEs, EEZs, or other obvious marine region classification. Regardless, we will use them to extract the North America cod stocks.*

Write code to pull all marine areas (listed in `ram$area`) that contain a certain substring
in their name -- ex. "Georges Bank". 
Hint: you want want to consider functions `filter()` or `grep()`

```{r}

```

We are interested in mapping the data from just the areas where Atlantic Cod are found.
Using the table you built above, pull out distinct areas that contain
Atlantic Cod populations into a new tidytable. 
Hint: you may want to use functions like `filter()` or `distinct()`

```{r}

```

## Task 3: Subsetting our data by regional id

Using bracket notation and or the `filter()` and `pull()` functions, try pulling 
certain subsets of ids from your table of cod areas. ex. the first 8 ids, or the ids of areas just within a certain country.

Create a vector of ids of areas with Atlantic Cod and in Canada. 

```{r}

```


## Task 4: Plotting Total Catch in Canada

Calculate and plot the catch in million tons (MT) of Atlantic Cod from
Canada using the data table and vector of ids you created above. 
Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `filter()`, and/or `summarise()`

```{r }


```

**Question:** How does this graph compare to the one presented above?

# Exercise 2: Group Assignment

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/img/worm2006.png)

**Question 1:** What years does this plot include? What is it plotting? 

## Task 1: Plotting total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

Adapting the table you created in the first exercise, select and 
manipulate the necessary columns to plot the number of total taxa caught each year 
from 1950 til 2006 using `geom_point()`. 

Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `tally()` and be sure to 
carefully consider how to handle or omit missing values. 

```{r}

```

## Task 2: Removing incomplete datasets

Species can either have missing data (within a series) or a time range 
that just doesn't span the full interval. Grouping by stockid instead of year, 
build a character vector containing only those stockids that have data for the 
full range (1950-2006).


```{r}

```

**Question 2:** How many taxa have data for the full range?

```{r}

```


## Task 3: Which fisheries have collapsed?

A fishery may be considered *collapsed* when total catch (TC) falls
below 10% of its peak. For those stocks with complete data sets, create a new 
tidy table including columns: `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, 
where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could
be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years
the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. 

```{r}

```

## Task 4: Plotting total catch

Using `geom_area()` plot the TC per stockid acros all years. 
```{r}

```

## Task 5: Calculating percent collapsed

To replicate the original plot, we must calculate the percent of taxa 
collapsed over time.
Using the `summarise()` function, and only the core stocks that have data 
across the full interval, build a new tidy table
that gives the fraction of all stocks that are collapsed in each year and 
include a cumulative column that gives the fraction of all years (between 1950 and each year)
that has experience at least one collapse. 

Hint: when logical vectors are summed or converted to numerics, TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0.

```{r}

```

## Task 6: Plotting proportion collapsed over time. 

Using `geom_line` twice to plot two individual lines (of different
colors please), plot the cumulative number of collapsed fisheries through time
and the fraction of collapsed fishers through time on the same graph.

Hint: try using `scale_y_reverse()` to flip the y axis for a different perspective
on these fractions.

```{r}


```

**Question 3:** What does this graph show us? How is it presenting information differently than the original graph for this exercise? Is it presenting the same information?
