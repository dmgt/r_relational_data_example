# Unit 3: Fisheries Collapse Module

This module will focus on understanding and replicating
fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse. 

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database)

First, load in the necessary libraries. Note that this time we need a package we 
haven't used before `readxl`. This package is useful for reading in .xls or 
.xlsx files. As always if you want more info on a package run `?readxl` after 
loading it.

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
library("scales") # For y-axis labels not in scientific notation - is there a better way to do this since 2012?
```

## Reading in the tables

```{r}
download.file("https://depts.washington.edu/ramlegac/wordpress/databaseVersions/RLSADB_v3.0_(assessment_data_only)_excel.zip", 
              "ramlegacy.zip")
path <- unzip("ramlegacy.zip")  # unzip the .xls files 
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(path) # use the readxl package to identify sheet names 

# purrr:map is the tidyverse version of lapply
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = path)  # read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
names(ram) <- sheets # give the list of datatables their assigned sheet names

## check the names
names(ram)

## check our data
head(ram$area)

```



# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

First, we seek to replicate the following figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data. 

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/fish/img/codcollapse.jpg)


## Task 1: Joining the necessary data

To replicate this plot, we need a table with the following columns: `"country"`, `"ssb_unit"`, `"catch_landings_unit"`, `"scientificname"`, `"commonname"`, `"year"`, `"ssb"`, and `"TC"`. 

Using the `select()` and `join()` functions you were introduced to in in Module 1,
build a tidy table with the desired columns. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Suggestion: separate blocks within each category added first, e.g. timeseriesunits <- select(data, TCunits=TC....)

# Code to look at categories of all the data tables
lapply(ram, names) # can use instead of viewer
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
Code to look at head() of all the data tables
lapply(ram, head)
```

```{r}
# Join our variables of interest
ourdata <- left_join(ram$timeseries_values_views, ram$timeseries_units_views, 
  by = c("assessid", "stockid")) %>%
  rename(SSB = SSB.x, SSBunits = SSB.y, Total_Catch = TC.x, Total_Catch_units = TC.y) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  select("year", "country", "scientificname", "commonname", "SSB", "SSBunits", "Total_Catch", "Total_Catch_units")

head(ourdata)
       
```

## Task 2: Mapping the Area table to marine regions

In order to replicate the collapse of Atlantic Cod, 
we need to be able to map area table from the Ram database to the marine regions. 

*As an aside, this database is unclear what kind of areas the `area` table is using, they do not appear to be LMEs, EEZs, or other obvious marine region classification. Regardless, we will use them to extract the North America cod stocks.*

Write code to pull all marine areas (listed in `ram$area`) that contain a certain substring
in their name -- ex. "Georges Bank". 
Hint: you want want to consider functions `filter()` or `grep()`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
GeorgesBank <- ram$area %>%
  filter(areaname == "Georges Bank")
GeorgesBank

```

We are interested in mapping the data from just the areas where Atlantic Cod are found.
Using the table you built above, pull out distinct areas that contain
Atlantic Cod populations into a new tidytable. 
Hint: you may want to use functions like `filter()` or `distinct()`

```{r}
# We don't have areaid because we took that out of our data table above. 
# We're building another table to include it!

ourdata_withareaid <- left_join(ram$timeseries_values_views, ram$timeseries_units_views, 
  by = c("assessid", "stockid")) %>%
  rename(SSB = SSB.x, SSBunits = SSB.y, Total_Catch = TC.x, Total_Catch_units = TC.y) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  select("year", "country", "areaid", "scientificname", "commonname", "SSB", "SSBunits", "Total_Catch", "Total_Catch_units")

cod_only <- ourdata_withareaid %>%
  filter(commonname == "Atlantic cod")
cod_only

```

## Task 3: Subsetting our data by regional id

Using bracket notation and or the `filter()` and `pull()` functions, try pulling 
certain subsets of ids from your table of cod areas. ex. the first 8 ids, or the ids of areas just within a certain country.

Create a vector of ids of areas with Atlantic Cod and in Canada. 

```{r}
#First experiment
cod_only %>%
  select(country, areaid) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid")

# The output above showed us that first 8 ids referred to DFO which is Canada, and NAFO
# which is multinational but next to Canadian waters, so we'll include both of these

CanadianCodareas <- cod_only %>%
   select(country, areaid) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  filter(areatype == "DFO" | areatype == "NAFO") %>%
  pull(areaid)

#Vector of ids with Atlantic cod and in or adjacent to Canadian waters
CanadianCodareas
```


## Task 4: Plotting Total Catch in Canada

Calculate and plot the catch in million tons (MT) of Atlantic Cod from
Canada using the data table and vector of ids you created above. 
Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `filter()`, and/or `summarise()`


```{r}
CanadianCodCatch <- cod_only %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  filter(areatype == "DFO" | areatype == "NAFO") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(CN_catch=sum(Total_Catch, na.rm = TRUE))

# note: below is an alternative way that we could have written this 
# and it gives same result so we are including it for reference

# CanadianCodCatch <- cod_only %>%
  # filter(areaid %in% CanadianCodareas) %>%
  # group_by(year) %>%
  # summarize(CN_catch=sum(Total_Catch, na.rm = TRUE))  


plot1 <- ggplot(CanadianCodCatch, aes(y = CN_catch, x = year)) +
      geom_line() +
      ylab("Cod catch in CA and adjacent waters (tons)")+
      xlab("Year")+
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = c( 0, 100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000, 600000, 700000, 800000, 900000, 1000000, 1100000), labels = comma) +
      theme_bw() +
      theme(text=element_text(size=16))
plot1  
```

**Question:** How does this graph compare to the one presented above? 

It shows a very similar trend of peak and collapse as the original plot, with slightly higher overall number of fish, probably because we also included the multinational fisheries bordering Canadian waters.

# Exercise 2: Group Assignment

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/img/worm2006.png)

**Question 1:** What years does this plot include? What is it plotting? 

* Plot includes the years 1950 - 2003
* It shows the percent of taxa classified as collapsed with diamonds representing collapses by year, triangles representing cumulative collapse, blue representing species poor large marine ecosystem areas (LMEs), red representing species rich areas, and black represnting the combined total (of poor and rich areas). 

## Task 1: Plotting total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

Adapting the table you created in the first exercise, select and 
manipulate the necessary columns to plot the number of total taxa caught each year 
from 1950 til 2006 using `geom_point()`. 

Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `tally()` and be sure to 
carefully consider how to handle or omit missing values. 

```{r}
# we need rows by year and a tally of each species caught for each year
tallied_species <- ourdata %>%
  filter(year >= 1950 & year <= 2006) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(scientificname))
head(tallied_species) # head data looks correct
tail(tallied_species) # tail data looks correct

## Now we can plot total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

total_taxa_plot <- ggplot(tallied_species, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Total taxa caught worldwide")+
      xlab("Year")+
      theme_bw() +
      theme(text=element_text(size=16))
total_taxa_plot
  
```

## Task 2: Removing incomplete datasets

Species can either have missing data (within a series) or a time range 
that just doesn't span the full interval. Grouping by stockid instead of year, 
build a character vector containing only those stockids that have data for the 
full range (1950-2006).


```{r}

# we need to get stockid back into our dataset
# we could probably just fix this in an earlier step but we're going to build a new table with it here

ourdata_withstockid <- left_join(ram$timeseries_values_views, ram$timeseries_units_views, 
  by = c("assessid", "stockid")) %>%
  rename(SSB = SSB.x, SSBunits = SSB.y, Total_Catch = TC.x, Total_Catch_units = TC.y) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  select("year", "country", "areaid", "stockid", "scientificname", "commonname", "SSB", "SSBunits", "Total_Catch", "Total_Catch_units")

stockid_fullyearrange <- ourdata_withstockid %>% 
  filter(year >= 1950 & year <= 2006) %>% # directed year range
  group_by(stockid) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%  # gives count of number of years each stock id is recorded 
  filter(count == 57) %>% # 57 is our full range of years 1950-2006
  select("stockid") # built character vector

head(stockid_fullyearrange) # character vector looks plausible

```

**Question 2:** How many taxa have data for the full range? 

63 taxa! See code below.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# There are 90 stock ids with data for the full range.
count(stockid_fullyearrange)
# But now we need to match this with species name for taxa count.

## Below code gives us full catch data again but filtered for our 90 stock ids
complete_catch_data <- semi_join(ourdata_withstockid, stockid_fullyearrange) %>%
  filter(year >= 1950 & year <= 2006)  # directed year range
```
```{r}
## This gives us a count of taxa from the new table we just created
complete_catch_data %>% 
  group_by(scientificname) %>%
  distinct(scientificname) %>%
  nrow()

# Note: could have used filter with %in% vector version of ==
```


## Task 3: Which fisheries have collapsed?

A fishery may be considered *collapsed* when total catch (TC) falls
below 10% of its peak. For those stocks with complete data sets, create a new 
tidy table including columns: `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, 
where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could
be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years
the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. 

```{r}
#First attempt to find peak TC between 1950 and 2006
 test_0 <- complete_catch_data %>%
          group_by(stockid) %>%
          mutate(PeakTC = max(Total_Catch)) %>% # do more mutate for % and if collapsed
          mutate(PercentOfPeak = (Total_Catch/PeakTC)) %>%
          mutate(Collapsed = (PercentOfPeak < 0.1)) %>% 
  #added logical operator TRUE = 1 means collapsed
  #this should allow us to do a sum of column for cumulative collapsed years
          mutate(Cumulative = cumsum(Collapsed)) %>%
          select(stockid, year, Total_Catch, PeakTC, PercentOfPeak, Collapsed, Cumulative)
  
head(test_0)
tail(test_0)

```

What the above table building revealed is that we haven't filtered all missing values out yet. Some of the taxa which we assumed had complete data based on having an entry for every year between 1950-2006 are actually missing stock or total catch data.

Another concern is that some fisheries are recorded as collapsed in earlier years because the total catch was initially less than 10% of the peak total catch. This doesn't really make sense because it is more of a statement of the fishing economy than the health of that fish stock at the time. This needs to be examined further and the count of cumulative collapsed years will not really be accurate until this has been resolved.

We looked into two ways to filter the missing data:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26665319/removing-na-in-dplyr-pipe?rq=1

* na.omit
* complete.cases

```{r}
#Experiment filtering complete_catch_data with complete.cases

test1 <- complete_catch_data %>%
          filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% # removes rows with NA values
          group_by(stockid) %>%
          mutate(PeakTC = max(Total_Catch)) %>% 
          mutate(PercentOfPeak = (Total_Catch/PeakTC)) %>%
          mutate(Collapsed = (PercentOfPeak < 0.1)) %>% 
          mutate(Cumulative = cumsum(Collapsed)) %>%
          select(stockid, year, Total_Catch, PeakTC, PercentOfPeak, Collapsed, Cumulative)
summary(test1)  
head(test1)
tail(test1)

test1 %>% 
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  distinct(stockid)

#Experiment filtering with na.omit


test2 <- complete_catch_data %>%
          na.omit() %>%     # removes rows with NA values
          group_by(stockid) %>%
          mutate(PeakTC = max(Total_Catch)) %>% 
          mutate(PercentOfPeak = (Total_Catch/PeakTC)) %>%
          mutate(Collapsed = (PercentOfPeak < 0.1)) %>% 
          mutate(Cumulative = cumsum(Collapsed)) %>%
          select(stockid, year, Total_Catch, PeakTC, PercentOfPeak, Collapsed, Cumulative)
  
summary(test2)
head(test2)
tail(test2)

test2 %>% 
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  distinct(stockid)

all.equal(test1,test2)
```


Either option for omitting NA's appears to give identical results. We should go forward with one method but we'll keep all of the code above as a reminder for the future.

```{r}
test_for_collapsed <- complete_catch_data %>%
          na.omit() %>%    
          group_by(stockid) %>%
          mutate(PeakTC = max(Total_Catch)) %>% 
          mutate(PercentOfPeak = (Total_Catch/PeakTC)) %>%
          mutate(Collapsed = (PercentOfPeak < 0.1)) %>% 
          mutate(Cumulative = cumsum(Collapsed)) %>%
          select(stockid, year, Total_Catch, PeakTC, PercentOfPeak, Collapsed, Cumulative)
```



## Task 4: Plotting total catch

Using `geom_area()` plot the TC per stockid across all years. 
```{r fig.width=11}
TCplot <- ggplot(test_for_collapsed, aes(x=year, y=Total_Catch, fill=stockid)) + 
    geom_area(colour="black", size=.2, alpha=.4) + 
    ylab("Total catch per stockid")+
    xlab("Year")+
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")

TCplot
```


Notes for futher work: 
- There's probably a way we can set up the conditional so only the values of TotalCatc that are below 10% and come *after* the peak TC value (eg based on comparing the year of TC > peak of PeakTC) are counted as collapsed
```
